## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, if you have Docker installed, you can use the docker image:

```bash
docker build -t random-employee-react .
docker run -p 3000:3000 random-employee-react 
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
